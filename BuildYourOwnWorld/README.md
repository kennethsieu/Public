## Algorithms

Genration Class -- generates the world. 
There is a starting room and from there we 
spawn new entry ways, document the coordinates of the entry way, and 
lastly we have a probality of either spawning a 
room or a hallways. 

Avatar class: Generates a new avatar
has a method that returns the world that the avatar is in
Also have methods that allow the avatar to 
move up/down/left/right.

Saving See File- alows us to save the seed of 
the lass current world by creating a new file
called current save

Load file actually opens up the file and reads the first line
it parses the seed/movements to load current games.

Testing Input/Generation: Allows to test/debug.

## Persistence

Using our sae seed/load file class.
